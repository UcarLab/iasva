Description: Iteratively Adjusted Surrogate Variable Analysis (IA-SVA) is a
    statistical framework to uncover hidden sources of variation even when
    these sources are correlated. IA-SVA provides a flexible methodology to
    i) identify a hidden factor for unwanted heterogeneity while adjusting
    for all known factors; ii) test the significance of the putative hidden
    factor for explaining the unmodeled variation in the data; and 
    iii), if significant, use the estimated factor as an additional known
    factor in the next iteration to uncover further hidden factors.
